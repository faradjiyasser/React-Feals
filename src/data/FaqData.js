            "CBD (cannabidiol) is found in many other plants but occurs in higher concentrations in the Cannabis sativa L. plant. CBD is one of at least 113 cannabinoids found in the sativa L. plant and is known for its therapeutic and healing properties." <br />"CBD works naturally with the body's endocannabinoid system and may help to promote calmness, clarity, and daily relief."

            "CBD interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is a network that helps regulate several functions including digestion, metabolism, mood, memory, sleep, motor control, pain perception, immune function, fertility, and pregnancy." <br /> "Anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness are three of the most common conditions people turn to CBD to help with."

        paragraph:"No, you can’t get blissed out on CBD alone. Its chemical cousin, THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), is the only cannabinoid that causes that typical “high” feeling. Hemp-derived CBD oil is extracted from low-THC cannabis plants—to be federally legal according to the 2018 US Farm Bill, there must be less than 0.3%. ",

        paragraph:<>
        "CBD by itself doesn’t show up on a drug test. However, there’s a chance you may get a false-positive result when taking a full-spectrum CBD product." <br />"Feals products are thoughtfully made with full-spectrum CBD oil that contains all of the compounds naturally found in the hemp plant. This includes a small amount of other naturally occurring cannabinoids like THC and CBN that work in tandem to give you the maximum benefits. All Feals products contain less than 0.3% THC, but due to the trace amounts present, there is an off-chance that you could test positive during a drug test." <br /> "If this is a concern, taking a cautious approach may be your best bet."
